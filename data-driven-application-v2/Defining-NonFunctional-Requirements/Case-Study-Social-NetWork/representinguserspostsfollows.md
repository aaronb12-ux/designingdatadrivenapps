# Home Timeline — Data Architecture

## Storage

All data is stored in a relational database.

| Table   | Relevant Columns                        |
|---------|-----------------------------------------|
| posts   | sender_id, timestamp, ...               |
| follows | follower_id, followee_id                |
| users   | id, ...                                 |

## Main Read Operation

The primary read operation is the home page, which displays recent posts from people the user is following.

### Query

```sql
SELECT posts.*, users.*
FROM posts
  JOIN follows ON posts.sender_id = follows.followee_id
  JOIN users   ON posts.sender_id = users.id
WHERE follows.follower_id = current_user
ORDER BY posts.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

### How it works

1. Use the `follows` table to find everyone `current_user` is following.
2. Look up recent posts made by those users.
3. Sort by timestamp and return the most recent 1000 posts.

## Scaling Problem

If we want up-to-date posts, clients could poll this query every 5 seconds while the user is online.

At 10 million active users, that means roughly 2 million queries per second.

The query itself is also expensive. If a user follows 200 people, the database must fetch recent posts from all 200 accounts and merge the results. At 2 million polls per second, that comes out to 400 million lookups per second.
